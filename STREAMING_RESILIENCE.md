# Streaming Resilience Implementation

## Problem
When sending messages, the streaming on the desktop would stop working correctly. While streaming wouldn't completely break, there was uncertainty about its behavior due to firewalls and network issues. The issue manifested as:
- Streaming stops when a message is sent
- Users need to refresh to see final results
- Messages don't persist if the connection drops

## Solution
This implementation adds a robust background polling system and improved streaming headers to ensure:

1. **Message Persistence**: Messages are automatically saved to the database and persist even if the HTTP connection drops
2. **Background Polling**: A polling system fetches message updates every 1.5 seconds while streaming is active
3. **Automatic Display**: Results are displayed as they arrive, even without an active HTTP connection
4. **No Refresh Needed**: Final results display automatically once streaming completes
5. **Firewall Compatibility**: Enhanced response headers prevent firewall/proxy timeouts

## Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **`useMessagePoller` Hook**: Polls for message updates in the background
  - Fetches latest messages via `/api/chat/[id]/messages`
  - Checks stream status via `/api/chat/[id]/status`
  - Automatically stops when streaming completes
  - Adapts polling frequency based on streaming state

- **`StreamingStatus` Component**: Shows real-time streaming status
  - Displays when streaming is active
  - Shows when polling for updates in background
  - Provides user feedback about process

### Backend Routes
- **`/api/search`**: Main streaming endpoint
  - Enhanced headers for firewall compatibility
  - Improved timeout handling
  - Better error recovery

- **`/api/chat/[id]/messages`**: Retrieve chat messages
  - Returns latest messages with pagination
  - Supports `limit` query parameter
  - No cache to ensure fresh data

- **`/api/chat/[id]/status`**: Check stream status
  - Returns whether streaming is complete
  - Provides message count
  - Detects if stream is active or stalled

### Streaming Enhancement Library
- **`streaming-heartbeat.ts`**: Provides optimized headers
  - `getStreamResponseHeaders()`: Headers that prevent firewall timeouts
  - `createStreamResponse()`: Creates properly configured streaming response
  - Includes `Keep-Alive` headers for long-running connections

## How It Works

1. **User sends a message**
   - Message is saved immediately to database
   - Streaming starts and response begins

2. **During streaming (if connection drops)**
   - Frontend continues polling for updates
   - Messages are displayed as they're saved to database
   - User sees "Fetching updates in background..." status

3. **Streaming completes**
   - Final message is saved to database
   - Polling detects completion and stops
   - Results display without requiring refresh

## Benefits

✅ **Resilient to Disconnections**: Works even if HTTP connection drops
✅ **No Manual Refresh Needed**: Results appear automatically
✅ **Firewall Compatible**: Enhanced headers prevent proxy timeouts
✅ **Real-time Feedback**: Users see streaming status
✅ **Database Backed**: All messages persist
✅ **Automatic Recovery**: Seamlessly recovers from network issues

## Configuration

### Polling Interval
Adjust in `hooks/use-message-poller.ts`:
```typescript
const pollingInterval = 1500; // milliseconds
```

### Streaming Timeout
Configured in `/api/search` response headers:
```
Keep-Alive: timeout=300, max=100  // 300 second timeout
```

## Testing

To verify the implementation:

1. Send a message with streaming enabled
2. Simulate a network interruption (DevTools Network tab → Offline)
3. Observe that:
   - Message appears in chat even without active connection
   - Status shows "Fetching updates in background..."
   - Once reconnected, updates resume automatically
   - Final result appears without requiring refresh

## Performance Considerations

- **Polling Frequency**: 1.5 seconds during streaming is conservative and won't overload the database
- **Database Queries**: Cached appropriately to minimize load
- **Network Bandwidth**: Polling uses minimal bandwidth (just JSON metadata)
- **Client-side Resources**: Lightweight hooks don't impact performance

## Future Enhancements

- Add WebSocket support for real-time updates (more efficient than polling)
- Implement exponential backoff for polling retries
- Add metrics for streaming success/failure rates
- Support for resumable uploads alongside downloads
